        <p>I am from Cuba. I moved to the UK 6 years ago and live now in London with my husband and daughter. I have been a stay 
            at home mum for a long time now and I am eager to start a job and retake my career. I started the Sky's 
            Get into Tech course and I am very excited for all the new things I have learned. Despite the gap in my tech 
            experience, I am confident that with the structured guidance provided in this course, I can successfully 
            land a career in software development.
        </p>

        <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me dancing - especially salsa, one of the main dances from my home country. 
        I also love spending time with my beautiful family and friends. I like attending tech community events, regularly 
        volunteer as a web developer, and enjoy teaching Spanish &#128522;
